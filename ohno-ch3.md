# The Ohno Protocol Specification
Version 1.0.0

## Chapter 3: Core Components

### Essential Protocol Structure

The Ohno Protocol is built on a foundation of trust, enabled by mandatory AI-generated analysis layered between human metadata and content. This three-layer approach ensures objective system understanding:

1. META Layer (Human-authored metadata)
2. SYNOPSIS Layer (AI-generated truth layer)
3. CONTENTS Layer (Human-authored content)

This structure is immutable and enforces the protocol's primary goal: enabling trustworthy human-AI collaboration through objective system analysis.

### File Structure

#### Pure Ohno Files (.ohno)
Every .ohno file MUST maintain this exact ordering to preserve the trust layer:

```
shebang
<blank-line>
meta-block     # Human context
<blank-line>
synopsis-block # AI analysis (mandatory)
<blank-line>
contents-block # Human content
```

The order is critical - SYNOPSIS must sit between META and CONTENTS to serve as an objective analysis barrier.

### Required Headers

#### META Block (Human Context)
Provides file metadata and human context:
```
#### META: Title: Authentication System
#### META: Version: 1.0.0
#### META: Author: Development Team
```

#### SYNOPSIS Block (AI Truth Layer)
The SYNOPSIS block is the cornerstone of the Ohno Protocol. It MUST:
- Be generated exclusively by AI
- Never be written or modified by humans
- Provide objective system analysis
- Identify potential issues and implications
- Update automatically upon system changes

Example of AI-generated analysis:
```
#### SYNOPSIS: Authentication system implements OAuth2.0
#### SYNOPSIS: Critical security component with unpatched vulnerabilities
#### SYNOPSIS: Memory leak detected in token validation
#### SYNOPSIS: API endpoints lack proper rate limiting
#### SYNOPSIS: Dependencies require security updates
```

The SYNOPSIS block serves as:
1. Truth Layer - Unbiased system analysis
2. Security Barrier - Identifies potential issues
3. Context Builder - Maps system relationships
4. Change Detector - Tracks system evolution
5. Trust Enforcer - Prevents human manipulation

#### CONTENTS Section
Contains the actual implementation details:
```
#### CONTENTS:
### SECTION: initialization
Implementation details...
### END: SECTION: initialization
```

### Trust Verification

#### Synopsis Validation
Tools implementing the Ohno Protocol MUST:
1. Verify SYNOPSIS is AI-generated
2. Prevent human modification
3. Maintain synopsis integrity
4. Update analysis automatically
5. Track analysis changes

#### Integrity Checking
```python
def verify_synopsis(file):
    assert is_ai_generated(file.synopsis)
    assert not has_human_modifications(file.synopsis)
    assert matches_system_state(file.synopsis)
```

### Chapter Summary
This chapter defines the core components of the Ohno Protocol, emphasizing the crucial role of the AI-generated SYNOPSIS as a mandatory trust layer between human metadata and content. This structure ensures objective system analysis and maintains the integrity of human-AI collaboration throughout the development process.
